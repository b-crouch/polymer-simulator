A tool to stochastically generate polymer conformation structures

This notebook randomly generates interactive models of polymer conformation structures with specified chemical formula, and, for each structure, computes the associated conformational entropy, ideal free energy, and entropic spring constant. Users can also compare characteristics of structures generated by different models for polymer conformation:
* Freely jointed chain model (no restrictions on bond orientations)
* Freely rotating chain model (bond angle is constant between monomers)
* Isometric rotation chain model (bond angle is constant; torsional angle is weighted by the preferred energetic orientation)
